Answer in **plain English**. If you can explain these without equations, you understand the foundations.

1) **Weights**
- What are weights, and why do we say “nothing is learned except the weights”?

2) **Loss**
- What is loss, and why can’t learning happen without it?

3) **Gradient vs Learning Rate**
- What does the gradient tell you?
- What does the learning rate control?
- What happens if the learning rate is too large or too small?

4) **Training vs Inference**
- What is the difference, and why do real-world failures often show up in inference?

5) **Overfitting & Validation**
- What is overfitting?
- How does a validation set help detect it?
