### **Welcome to Module 4**

This module explains **how machine learning and deep learning actually work**, and why modern AI systems (including LLMs) behave the way they do.

It is **conceptual first**, with **light, real code** to ground ideas. By the end of this module, the behaviour of LLMs should feel *inevitable*, not mysterious.

This module builds directly on:

- **Module 1:** Python fundamentals (functions, JSON, notebooks)
- **Module 2:** Data work with Pandas and visualisation
- **Module 3:** LLM Fundamentals (inference, hallucinations, constraints)

### **What You Will Learn**

| Topic | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| AI vs ML vs DL vs GenAI | Set correct expectations and vocabulary |
| Neural network anatomy | Understand what models actually are |
| Weights, biases, activations | Grasp the building blocks |
| Loss functions & gradient descent | Know how models learn |
| Overfitting vs underfitting | Recognise and mitigate common failures |
| PyTorch vs TensorFlow/Keras | Understand the two dominant frameworks |
| Why LLMs hallucinate | Connect training dynamics to behaviour |
| Why grounding (RAG) is required | Bridge to enterprise reliability |
