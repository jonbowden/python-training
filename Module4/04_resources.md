# Module 4 Additional Resources — ML & DL Foundations

## Conceptual Foundations
- Michael Nielsen — *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* (Chapters 1–2)
- Andrew Ng — ML course (focus: loss, overfitting, bias/variance)

## The Big Two Frameworks
- PyTorch tutorials: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/
- TensorFlow/Keras quickstart: https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras

## Practical Notes for Financial Services
- Data quality and bias shape model behaviour
- Separate training vs inference responsibilities
- Validate, monitor, and govern models like any other critical system

## Bridge to next modules
- Embeddings + vector search enable retrieval
- RAG grounds LLM outputs with evidence to reduce hallucination risk
