**CodeVision Python Training**

### **Contents**

  * **Part 1: LLM Foundations** (Sections 1-5)
  * **Part 2: Working with LLM APIs** (Sections 6-10)

### **Welcome to Module 3**

This module introduces **Large Language Models (LLMs)** from an engineering and enterprise perspective. It is code-first, grounded in Python, and builds directly on:

- **Module 1:** Python fundamentals (functions, JSON, notebooks)
- **Module 2:** Data work with Pandas and visualisation

You will learn how LLMs work, how to call them from Python, how they fail, and how to use them safely in regulated environments such as banking and financial services.

### **LLM Gateway Access**

All LLM access in this module goes through a **gateway abstraction** — a single HTTPS endpoint that works identically from:

- **Google Colab** (remote notebook)
- **Local Jupyter** (laptop)
- **VS Code** (local development)

**What you need:**
- `LLM_BASE_URL` — the JBChat gateway endpoint (e.g., `https://jbchat.jonbowden.com.ngrok.app`)
- `LLM_API_KEY` — provided by your instructor (optional, depending on setup)

**Students do not:**
- Install Ollama locally
- Generate their own tokens
- Manage tunnelling or networking

This mirrors enterprise practice where LLM access is centrally managed and secured.

### **What You Will Learn**

| Topic | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| What LLMs are (and aren't) | Set correct expectations |
| Tokens & context windows | Understand input limits |
| Temperature & determinism | Control output consistency |
| Structured output (JSON) | Enable automation |
| Hallucinations | Recognise and handle failures |
| Enterprise constraints | Audit, compliance, safety |
| Gateway security | Prevent API misuse |
