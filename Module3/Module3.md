### **Welcome to Module 3**

This module introduces **Large Language Models (LLMs)** from an engineering and enterprise perspective. It is code-first, grounded in Python, and builds directly on:

- **Module 1:** Python fundamentals (functions, JSON, notebooks)
- **Module 2:** Data work with Pandas and visualisation

You will learn how LLMs work, how to call them from Python, how they fail, and how to use them safely in regulated environments such as banking and financial services.

### **LLM Access Options**

You have two options for running LLM exercises:

**Option A: Local Ollama (Recommended for learning)**
- Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) on your PC
- Pull the required model: `ollama pull phi3:mini`
- Runs entirely on your machine - no network required

**Option B: Remote CodeVision LLM API**
- Use the course-provided LLM endpoint
- No installation required
- Requires authentication (your course login)

Both options use the same API shape - your code works by changing one URL.

### **What You Will Learn**

| Topic | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| What LLMs are (and aren't) | Set correct expectations |
| Tokens & context windows | Understand input limits |
| Temperature & determinism | Control output consistency |
| Structured output (JSON) | Enable automation |
| Hallucinations | Recognise and handle failures |
| Enterprise constraints | Audit, compliance, safety |

### **Prerequisites**

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Module 1 (Python Foundations)
- Completed Module 2 (Python for Data Work)
- Either Ollama installed locally OR access to the CodeVision LLM API
