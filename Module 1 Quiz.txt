# ?? **WRITTEN / SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS (20 QUESTIONS)**

Use these to test reasoning and expression.

### **WR1**

Explain the difference between a list and a tuple.

**Expected answer:**
A list is mutable; a tuple is immutable.

### **WR2**

Why are dictionaries useful when working with JSON data?

**Expected answer:**
Because JSON maps naturally to key–value pairs.

### **WR3**

Write an `if` statement that prints `"OK"` if `x` is greater than 10.

**Expected answer:**

```python
if x > 10:
    print("OK")
```

### **WR4**

Write a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 3.

**Expected answer:**

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    print(i)
```
### **WR5**

What is the purpose of a function?

**Expected answer:**
To group reusable logic and improve readability.

### **WR6**

Write a function that returns double the input value.

**Expected answer:**

```python
def double(x):
    return x * 2
```

### **WR7**

Explain why file handling is important in data pipelines.

**Expected answer:**
Because data must be read from and written to files reliably.

### **WR8**

What does this code do?

```python
json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
```

**Expected answer:**
Writes structured JSON to a file in readable format.

### **WR9**

Why is JSON commonly used in AI systems?

**Expected answer:**
It is structured, language-agnostic, and easy to parse.

### **WR10**

What is one advantage of notebooks over scripts?

**Expected answer:**
They allow interactive experimentation and immediate feedback.

### **WR11**

What happens if you forget to close a file?

**Expected answer:**
It may remain open and cause resource issues.

### **WR12**

Explain the difference between `for` and `while` loops.

**Expected answer:**
`for` loops iterate over known sequences; `while` loops run until a condition changes.

### **WR13**

What does `type(x)` return?

**Expected answer:**
The data type of `x`.

### **WR14**

Why is indentation critical in Python?

**Expected answer:**
It defines code blocks and structure.

### **WR15**

Give an example of when a set is useful.

**Expected answer:**
When storing unique values.

### **WR16**

What is a module in Python?

**Expected answer:**
A file containing reusable Python code.

### **WR17**

Why should code be split into functions?

**Expected answer:**
For reuse, clarity, and easier testing.

### **WR18**
