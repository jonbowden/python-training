# Module 1 - Python (Foundations & Applied)

![CodeVision Logo](CV_White.png)

This section introduces the fundamental building blocks that make Python clear, expressive, and easy to learn. Learners explore how the language “thinks” — from creating variables and working with basic data types to writing simple expressions and controlling program flow.

By the end of this segment, they’ll comfortably use Python’s core constructs to solve small problems, test ideas, and understand the foundation on which all later modules are built.

### Topics include:
* Variables and basic data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
* Operators and expressions
* Lists, dictionaries, and other essential collections
* Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Loops for repeating actions (`for`, `while`)

> **Note:** This is a gentle, hands-on introduction designed to give learners early wins and the confidence to move deeper into Python.
